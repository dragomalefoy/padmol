# What is this?

_I wanted to gather my favourite pieces of code, I seem to forget they exist and/or not remember where I store them. I've structured the underworld as such:_


| Title   | Purpose                                                                    | Total | Jump Down |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|-----------|
| Demeter | Mami-starters, all the usual starter files that I spent too much time on.  |       |           |
| Hera    |                                                                            |       |           |
|         |                                                                            |       |           |
|         |                                                                            |       |

### what i could answer if feeling stuck:
- [x] Do i want to sort by _function_ or _language_?
    - [ ] obviously, I want to sort initially by function, and further down by language
- [x] Should i priorotize _few folders_ or _precision_?
    - [ ] Clicking is not reasonable
- [x] How many readmes are needed
    - [ ] For now, only this one, but I will add one per every large directory. But I dont need more at the moment.


### Problems I want to solve with this project

        - [ ] Im tired of guessing where everything is. 
        - [ ] Lack of overview of what languages i favor
        - [ ] if i write sass-styles, I might as well save them.
        - [ ] i wish to up my react-game
        - [ ] its not that i dont like libraries, I just have very strong opinions.
        - [ ] and honestly, i will save time by not having to learn how to implement a whole library only to use one tiny component
        - [ ] when i make something work, i dont want to re-do the struggle for every project
